Say goodbye to flowery diaper bags...Now there's Diaper Dude. Diaper Dude is not your average diaper bag. It was designed with dad in mind. The bag has one large compartment for baby with mesh pocket and an additional compartment for dad with mesh pocket. It includes an insulated bottle holder and a dad checklist screened on the flap. Diaper Dude is more than a diaper bag company, it's a movement created by Chris Pegula after the birth of his first child. As a lifestyle and a brand, Diaper Dude is committed to the ideal that parenthood can be uncomplicated and cool. Dads and moms can easily access diapers, bottles, clothes, wipes and more and still carry around a modern looking diaper bag    ","{""original"":""https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_ipw9bMZApp4_600x450.jpg"",""thumb"":""https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_ipw9bMZApp4_50x50c.jpg"",""id"":""ipw9bMZApp4""},{""original"":""https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_l99Uluqdbr7_600x450.jpg"",""thumb"":""https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_l99Uluqdbr7_50x50c.jpg"",""id"":""l99Uluqdbr7""},{""original"":""https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_hOUghIVIzll_600x450.jpg"",""thumb"":""https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_hOUghIVIzll_50x50c.jpg"",""id"":""hOUghIVIzll""}",diaper bag,40.967181,-73.715627,Diaper Dude,Messenger Diaper Bag,2017-01-30  7:59am,5981643158,Diaper Dude Messenger Diaper Bag - Grey,null,null,http://newyork.craigslist.org/wch/bab/5981643158.html

The Learn-Around Playground is the first all-in-one activity center that links physical movements to learning connections as baby grows from sitting and crawling to standing and cruising. There are 45 interactive touch points and two fun learning modes: Learn & Grow and Compose & Play. Just flip the ""smart"" book page to transform learning activities into musical adventures.Babies bat, tug and push interactive points to learn about colors, shapes, textures and cause & effect. Toddlers discover and create by playing alphabet, counting, and musical games. What it Teaches: * Songs * Shapes * Textures * Colors * 
It does NOT have a tube and balls, hence a huge discount. Please call or text

This Is A Brand Never Used Aquabot Ultra, A Truly Professional Grade Swimming Pool Cleaner .....  
 
I respond only by phone If you're interested give me your contact info. 
 
Please Note "" Because I Purchased It Two Years Ago There Is No Manufacturers Warranty"" ..... It's been Stored In My Climate Controlled Basement since purchased 
 
I Removed It From The Factory Box To Test ..... This Machine has Never Seen Water.... The Wireless Remote In Still In The Factory Plastic as is the Power Supply ... see pics 
 
 The Power Cord Is 75' Long..... My Pool Is 66' x 24' and The Cord Is Easily long Enough 
 
I purchased my first Ultrabot 4 years ago and because it worked so well I made up my mind that I would never use anything else to vacuum my pool. So two years ago I purchased another one to have as a spare in case my original Ultrabot malfunctioned. Turns out that these units are designed so well that my original never had a break down, still going strong going on 5 years now. So now I decided to sell my spare.  
 
There is normal maintenance like the rummer tracks, just replaced them on my original which lasted 5 years btw, and it's running like the champion cleaner it's always been. 
 
Product Description 
The ultimate cleaner offers far greater performance and options than any other mchine. The Ultrabot offers a remote control feature and dual motors. The Ultrabot filters an incomparable 4,800 gallons per hour. A very special feature that is rarely found amongst pool cleaners is the dual programs this cleaner features. You can program your cleaner to be a bottom dweller or and floor/wall climber! 
 
Operating independently of the pools main filter, the Ultrabot works without hoses, hook-ups, booster pumps and suction lines. Just place the Ultrabot in the water, plug it in, push a button and voila! The pool gets cleaned...automatically! 
 
Ultilizing a highly efficient, reusbale filer baf and power driven scrubbing brushes, every Ultrabot is capable of filtering unwanted debris as small as 2 microns in size, yet still allow up to 4800 gallons per hour. The end result? Small debris such as sand, silt, hair, metal particles, bacteria and most algae, as well as large debris such as acorns, twigs, and leaves, are all quickly and permanently removed, leaving you with a cleaner, healthier and more beautiful pool! 
 
STANDARD FEATURES: 
 
110 Volt 
1 year manufacturer warranty  
75 foot Cable Assembly  
Maximum pool size 225,000 gal.  
Cleaner speed 1 FPS  
Filtration of 70 GPM  
Filter debris holding capacity 30 lbs  
FlexiFlap√¢‚Äû¬¢ Bristle Brushes  
Approx. clean time about 5 Hours

I restored this 1977 MGB over the past 3 years, it is my third full MGB restoration and I think it is the best one yet. The car sat in a friend's storage building for several years, when he realized that he was not going to get around to it anytime soon we made a deal. A Virginia Inspection Sticker from 2004 shows how long it sat dormant. When I brought the car home it was 3 different colors and a previous owner's attempted repairs were in need of attention. Before anything else, I charged the 10 year old battery that was in the car, improvised a temporary fuel supply, changed the oil and filter, filled the radiator and when the key was turned the car actually started and ran reasonably well. Not being one to leave things as they are I decided to begin a full tear down.  I removed the entire interior, all exterior trim, lights, bumpers and all wiring, leaving a rolling shell. Next I thoroughly cleaned and de-greased the entire body sanded off the majority of the existing paint and  sprayed everything with self etching primer. The car was then sent to a paint and body specialist where all existing rust and poorly done body work was addressed, including; installation of New British Heritage floor panels on both sides and the trunk, New Aftermarket Front Fenders and New Dog Leg Repair Panels on both sides. The car was then mounted on a rotisserie for complete water-borne abrasive blasting to bare metal and application of epoxy primer followed by multiple coats of, Single Stage Valspar HS Polyurethane 840 Topcoat, in ""Chartreuse"", the original factory color of the car. I have about a pint of the paint remaining which will be provided to the next owner for future touch-ups. Once I got the car back to my garage I began the reassembly process. The engine that came with the car was sent to a local shop for a complete rebuild with new cam, bearings, pistons, rings, seals, resurfaced head with new valve springs and seals, new oil and water pumps and fresh engine paint in black. The 4 speed Transmission has new, clutch, master cylinder, flex line and slave cylinder, front and rear seals and shifts easily. The distributor was replaced with a Petronix unit and a Bosch coil is installed. I replaced the original single ZS carb and intake/exhaust manifold with 2 Brand New SU HS4 carbs on factory pre-1975 intake and exhaust manifolds plus a Moss Motors/K&N filter cold air intake. A Tourist Trophy, Polished Stainless Steel full exhaust system has been added. The front suspension features rebuilt Shocks and King Pins, all new bushings, refinished A-Arms, cross member and sway bar, new rack boots, new tie rod ends and Moss Lowering Springs. Rear Suspension has all new bushings, rebound straps, rebuilt shocks and Moss Lowering Blocks with new U-Bolts and hardware. Complete Brake system is updated with new Master Cylinder, rebuilt Power Brake Booster and front calipers, new rotors, pads and flexible lines plus new rear shoes, wheel cylinders and adjusters.  Interior has recovered Black Vinyl seats, new carpet and door panels and new dash pad. A black NOS Amco top was installed by a local specialist. A new Sears Gold Battery is in place and Factory Wiring Harness has been reinstalled. All lights, gauges and horns are working as designed. Front and Rear bumpers are completely refinished and look better than new. I have driven the car about 1000 miles since Spring 2016 and am confident in it's performance. So, if you are looking for a fun, reliable, reasonably priced classic car that will get compliments whenever driven come see and test drive this great 1977 MGB while you can. All receipts will be shown to interested parties. I have many more photos of the restoration and welcome all inquiries. Thanks for reading about my 1977 MGB. Miles indicated are not accurate.

The price is low because the car needs a head gasket and coolant reservoir.   The top works perfectly as well.   
 
Over the past year I have replaced many parts including a new exhaust, centric rotors and akebono brake pads, brake booster, fuel pump, spark plugs, cps sensor, oxygen sensor, fuel pressure regulator, evap purge valve, fan resistor. I've also replaced many hoses with silicone. In that time the car had only been driven about 7000 miles so the parts are all practically new. 
 
The Sid display is usually not functioning on these cars but I had it fixed by BBA remanufacturing. 
 
The car also has some upgrades: stage 1 tune with t7 bpc, genuine Saab anti roll bar and steering rack and brace. 
 
Included with the purchase is the remaining silicone cooling system hoses I didn't replace, a spare set of spark plugs, oil filters, 3 gallons of transmission fluid for a flush (it didn't need it but I had planned on doing it for maintenance). Also a new in package valve cover gasket, and a few other small parts I had bought for it. 
 
Price is firm.

I am selling a late 70's Carvin DT650 Double Neck Guitar with original case. I believe this guitar was only made for a few years. 
 
There are a lot of unique features to this doubleneck guitar, including two input jacks if you want to split the two necks into different channels, individually customizable pickups where you can switch them from single coil to dual coil operation, and more. An original brochure detailing all of the ins and outs can be found here: http://www.carvinmuseum.com/decade/images/77-dt650.html 
 
This guitar plays well and sounds good. The body and pickups are in good shape. However, there are two notable issues that you should know: the headstock on the 12 string snapped and was repaired in a prior life (according to the prior owner several decades ago), but the repair job is a bit ugly and there are marks from the clamp and the seam was not properly sanded before refinished. When I brought the guitar in for a set up in May 2015, a repair technician said that the head was still stable and balanced. The other minor issue is that there's a slight gouge on the 12th fret of the 12 string guitar fretboard --- this does not affect playing and seems to be solely cosmetic. Both issues are highlighted in the images. Otherwise this guitar is a really unique instrument that is both highly practical (perhaps more so than most double necks due to the features) and extremely beautiful. 
 
I will throw in a heavy duty padded strap as well.

This co-sleeper is so well designed. It keeps baby close and totally accessible and visible, but safe -- you don't have to worry about rolling over or having the blankets cover them in the night. The side can be lowered, so you can have your arm right on your baby while you're lying in bed. Also a great transition piece from co-sleeping to a regular crib.

History and nature meet upon the beautiful grounds of Cloverleaf Memorial Cemetery. Nestled in central New Jersey in the Woodbridge Township, Cloverleaf features well maintained lawns and mature shade trees. The grounds of Cloverleaf are part of history; memories of the past flicker through the air and a peaceful solitude can be found when visiting the grounds. 
With grave markers dating back to 1926, Cloverleaf sits upon historical ground. George Washington stayed in Woodbridge on his travel to take the office of President back in 1789. Woodbridge was also home to several historical figures including Captain John Pike and Tom Bloomfield. As one of the largest townships in the country, Woodbridge is not only historically significant but also beautifully preserved.

Limited Edition of just 200 Individually numbered pieces! 
 
Weiss Watch Company is proud to offer a mechanical timepiece built in the USA. Each fully mechanical movement is a manually wound Caliber 1001 comprised of over 100 Swiss parts that are hand-finished and assembled in Los Angeles, California. The case and caseback are machined from one solid piece of stainless steel and polished individually by hand. Sapphire crystals are used on the front and back of the case for strength and durability and display our highly finished movement inside. Hands are high polished silver with latte luminescent Super-Luminova paint for legibility in the dark. Dials are machined from one solid piece of naval brass and have been hand painted for maximum legibility. The Limited Issue Field Watch Black Dial is supplied with Horween's Genuine Shell Cordovan black strap. The shells endure a 6-month tanning process at Horween, the oldest operating tannery in America. Skilled artisans tan, stuff, polish, steep in vegetable liquors, hand curry, and hand shave each piece of shell. Each strap is individually handmade in the USA by expert leather craftsmen. Since each one is handcrafted, each strap has its own unique characteristics from the tanning process and handmade nature of the product. The strap is designed for comfort, style, and is made specially to fit the Field Watch with 20mm lug size and an 18mm 316 stainless steel buckle. The Limited Issue Field Watch Black Dial is a limited series of 200 numbered timepieces built by hand. Each individually numbered timepiece is delivered in our custom-built California pine wood box, also built by hand in the USA.

Linley File Cabinet, White: A leather-covered top allows this file cabinet to double as an occasional table in the home office. It is designed to hold both legal and letter size files. Casters on the bottom allow for easy mobility, and the bottom file drawer is supported by an extra caster to keep the cabinet from tipping forward.In 1985 Trig Liljestrand began importing furniture from his native Sweden into the United States, as part of his mission to make beautifully designed furniture affordable and available to everyone. Today the Euro Ãß Style design team continues to use the best materials to create wonderfully designed and crafted furnishings.

I'm no longer doing any home recording and I'm selling my pro recording equipment. This RME ADI-8 DS converter has only approximately 75hrs of use. There are zero marks on it and it is basically in brand new condition. Check out Sweetwater or Sam Ash for complete specs. 
 
DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS 
The ADI-8 DS is an 8 channel AD/DA converter with reference approach. The compact 19"" 1U rackmount enclosure includes several outstanding features, like Intelligent Clock Control (ICC), SyncCheck√Ç¬Æ, SyncAlign√Ç¬Æ, TDIF/ADAT converter and Bit Splitter. AD- and DA-circuit automatically operate either independently or linked. The latest 24 bit converters with 128 times oversampling achieve 117 dBA true dynamic range. All digital inputs and outputs operate at full 24-bit resolution. If you have been waiting for a flexible, fully professional yet affordable multi-channel converter - the wait is over. 
 
DS stands for Double Speed, meaning double sample rate. As ADAT√Ç¬Æ optical does not support sample rates higher than 48 kHz the DS mode requires two channels to transmit the data of one channel. The used method called Sample Split is compatible to S/MUX, and also found in the Hammerfall and Hammerfall Light. The combination Hammerfall/ADI-8 DS allows DVD-compatible Hi-End recordings (up to 8 channel @ 96 kHz), at an astonishing low price. 
 
Features: 
8 channel AD-converter, completely symmetrical and DC-coupled audio path, 117 dBA SNR AD 
8 channel DA-converter, balanced output, 112 dBA DA 
ADAT optical inputs, 24 bit, based on RME's unsurpassed Bitclock PLL for sample accurate lock 
ADAT optical outputs, 24 bit, fully compatible to all ADAT optical inputs 
TDIF-1 interface, 24 bit, Low Jitter PLL, Emphasis support, DA-88 compatible 
Bit Split/Combine, Yamaha 02R compatible technique to record 24 bit data onto 16 bit machines 
Copy Mode adds a unique 24 bit ADAT to/from TDIF converter 
Bit Split/Combine, Copy Mode, ADAT and TDIF usable in all combinations 
Digital Patchbay operation, allows to copy, duplicate and distribute the digital input signals 
Dither available, for full compatibility to 16 bit even at 96 kHz 
SyncCheck, unique technology to check clock synchronisation 
Virtual Sample Buffer, allows to use the internal Low Jitter Clock (quarz crystal) even for DA-conversion 
Automatic storage of all settings

These are faux Chanel earrings. They are not Chanel. Chanel has never designed a pair similar to this. The only thing similar is the double C design. The design is different. They are not authentic. Even if they are not authentic they are still made very well. Gold plated with cubic zirconia. 
Will ship to USA locations for $3 flat rate. Also accepting best offers. Nothing below $20 will be responded to.
