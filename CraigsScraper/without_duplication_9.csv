I have 32 Mother ease adjustable diapers with all necessary accessories.  The Mother ease adjustable diapers are super easy to use.  I diapered my first two children with this type of diaper until they each began potty training, then sold my diapers because I didn't anticipate having another baby.  When the accidental third baby came along, I bought a new set of diapers.  I only used these for about nine months, so these have had relatively little use (a family crisis caused an interruption of our family routine, and I never got back in the habit of cloth diapering).  They do not have stains.  To look at them, you would think they were new.  I will accept reasonable offers. 
 
What I am selling: 
32 Mother ease One-Size cotton diapers; here's a link to the retail website with details about these diapers - https://cart.mother-ease.com/collections/one-size-diaper 
 
8 Mother ease covers (2 small, 6 medium) 
 
6 Mother ease cotton liners 
 
14 Polyester fleece liners that wick moisture away from the skin

I'm selling my City Select Double Stroller by Baby Jogger plus accessories for $400, cash only, price is firm. This is a fantastic stroller for families with two young kids, as you can adapt to 16 different configurations (front facing, parent facing, sibling facing, etc). I also am selling the following accessories including an awesome Glider Board for your big kid to ride rather than sit, a tray, plus more. In total, the stroller and accessories originally retails at $715. I'm selling as a bundle at 40% off, as this has been gently used and in great condition. Note, this does not include a second seat.
