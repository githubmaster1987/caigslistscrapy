This Is A Brand Never Used Aquabot Ultra, A Truly Professional Grade Swimming Pool Cleaner .....  
 
I respond only by phone If you're interested give me your contact info. 
 
Please Note "" Because I Purchased It Two Years Ago There Is No Manufacturers Warranty"" ..... It's been Stored In My Climate Controlled Basement since purchased 
 
I Removed It From The Factory Box To Test ..... This Machine has Never Seen Water.... The Wireless Remote In Still In The Factory Plastic as is the Power Supply ... see pics 
 
 The Power Cord Is 75' Long..... My Pool Is 66' x 24' and The Cord Is Easily long Enough 
 
I purchased my first Ultrabot 4 years ago and because it worked so well I made up my mind that I would never use anything else to vacuum my pool. So two years ago I purchased another one to have as a spare in case my original Ultrabot malfunctioned. Turns out that these units are designed so well that my original never had a break down, still going strong going on 5 years now. So now I decided to sell my spare.  
 
There is normal maintenance like the rummer tracks, just replaced them on my original which lasted 5 years btw, and it's running like the champion cleaner it's always been. 
 
Product Description 
The ultimate cleaner offers far greater performance and options than any other mchine. The Ultrabot offers a remote control feature and dual motors. The Ultrabot filters an incomparable 4,800 gallons per hour. A very special feature that is rarely found amongst pool cleaners is the dual programs this cleaner features. You can program your cleaner to be a bottom dweller or and floor/wall climber! 
 
Operating independently of the pools main filter, the Ultrabot works without hoses, hook-ups, booster pumps and suction lines. Just place the Ultrabot in the water, plug it in, push a button and voila! The pool gets cleaned...automatically! 
 
Ultilizing a highly efficient, reusbale filer baf and power driven scrubbing brushes, every Ultrabot is capable of filtering unwanted debris as small as 2 microns in size, yet still allow up to 4800 gallons per hour. The end result? Small debris such as sand, silt, hair, metal particles, bacteria and most algae, as well as large debris such as acorns, twigs, and leaves, are all quickly and permanently removed, leaving you with a cleaner, healthier and more beautiful pool! 
 
STANDARD FEATURES:

1 year manufacturer warranty

I restored this 1977 MGB over the past 3 years, it is my third full MGB restoration and I think it is the best one yet. The car sat in a friend's storage building for several years, when he realized that he was not going to get around to it anytime soon we made a deal. A Virginia Inspection Sticker from 2004 shows how long it sat dormant. When I brought the car home it was 3 different colors and a previous owner's attempted repairs were in need of attention. Before anything else, I charged the 10 year old battery that was in the car, improvised a temporary fuel supply, changed the oil and filter, filled the radiator and when the key was turned the car actually started and ran reasonably well. Not being one to leave things as they are I decided to begin a full tear down.  I removed the entire interior, all exterior trim, lights, bumpers and all wiring, leaving a rolling shell. Next I thoroughly cleaned and de-greased the entire body sanded off the majority of the existing paint and  sprayed everything with self etching primer. The car was then sent to a paint and body specialist where all existing rust and poorly done body work was addressed, including; installation of New British Heritage floor panels on both sides and the trunk, New Aftermarket Front Fenders and New Dog Leg Repair Panels on both sides. The car was then mounted on a rotisserie for complete water-borne abrasive blasting to bare metal and application of epoxy primer followed by multiple coats of, Single Stage Valspar HS Polyurethane 840 Topcoat, in ""Chartreuse"", the original factory color of the car. I have about a pint of the paint remaining which will be provided to the next owner for future touch-ups. Once I got the car back to my garage I began the reassembly process. The engine that came with the car was sent to a local shop for a complete rebuild with new cam, bearings, pistons, rings, seals, resurfaced head with new valve springs and seals, new oil and water pumps and fresh engine paint in black. The 4 speed Transmission has new, clutch, master cylinder, flex line and slave cylinder, front and rear seals and shifts easily. The distributor was replaced with a Petronix unit and a Bosch coil is installed. I replaced the original single ZS carb and intake/exhaust manifold with 2 Brand New SU HS4 carbs on factory pre-1975 intake and exhaust manifolds plus a Moss Motors/K&N filter cold air intake. A Tourist Trophy, Polished Stainless Steel full exhaust system has been added. The front suspension features rebuilt Shocks and King Pins, all new bushings, refinished A-Arms, cross member and sway bar, new rack boots, new tie rod ends and Moss Lowering Springs. Rear Suspension has all new bushings, rebound straps, rebuilt shocks and Moss Lowering Blocks with new U-Bolts and hardware. Complete Brake system is updated with new Master Cylinder, rebuilt Power Brake Booster and front calipers, new rotors, pads and flexible lines plus new rear shoes, wheel cylinders and adjusters.  Interior has recovered Black Vinyl seats, new carpet and door panels and new dash pad. A black NOS Amco top was installed by a local specialist. A new Sears Gold Battery is in place and Factory Wiring Harness has been reinstalled. All lights, gauges and horns are working as designed. Front and Rear bumpers are completely refinished and look better than new. I have driven the car about 1000 miles since Spring 2016 and am confident in it's performance. So, if you are looking for a fun, reliable, reasonably priced classic car that will get compliments whenever driven come see and test drive this great 1977 MGB while you can. All receipts will be shown to interested parties. I have many more photos of the restoration and welcome all inquiries. Thanks for reading about my 1977 MGB. Miles indicated are not accurate.

The price is low because the car needs a head gasket and coolant reservoir.   The top works perfectly as well.   
 
Over the past year I have replaced many parts including a new exhaust, centric rotors and akebono brake pads, brake booster, fuel pump, spark plugs, cps sensor, oxygen sensor, fuel pressure regulator, evap purge valve, fan resistor. I've also replaced many hoses with silicone. In that time the car had only been driven about 7000 miles so the parts are all practically new. 
 
The Sid display is usually not functioning on these cars but I had it fixed by BBA remanufacturing. 
 
The car also has some upgrades: stage 1 tune with t7 bpc, genuine Saab anti roll bar and steering rack and brace. 
 
Included with the purchase is the remaining silicone cooling system hoses I didn't replace, a spare set of spark plugs, oil filters, 3 gallons of transmission fluid for a flush (it didn't need it but I had planned on doing it for maintenance). Also a new in package valve cover gasket, and a few other small parts I had bought for it.

I am selling a late 70's Carvin DT650 Double Neck Guitar with original case. I believe this guitar was only made for a few years. 
 
There are a lot of unique features to this doubleneck guitar, including two input jacks if you want to split the two necks into different channels, individually customizable pickups where you can switch them from single coil to dual coil operation, and more. An original brochure detailing all of the ins and outs can be found here: http://www.carvinmuseum.com/decade/images/77-dt650.html 
 
This guitar plays well and sounds good. The body and pickups are in good shape. However, there are two notable issues that you should know: the headstock on the 12 string snapped and was repaired in a prior life (according to the prior owner several decades ago), but the repair job is a bit ugly and there are marks from the clamp and the seam was not properly sanded before refinished. When I brought the guitar in for a set up in May 2015, a repair technician said that the head was still stable and balanced. The other minor issue is that there's a slight gouge on the 12th fret of the 12 string guitar fretboard --- this does not affect playing and seems to be solely cosmetic. Both issues are highlighted in the images. Otherwise this guitar is a really unique instrument that is both highly practical (perhaps more so than most double necks due to the features) and extremely beautiful. 
 
I will throw in a heavy duty padded strap as well.

This co-sleeper is so well designed. It keeps baby close and totally accessible and visible, but safe -- you don't have to worry about rolling over or having the blankets cover them in the night. The side can be lowered, so you can have your arm right on your baby while you're lying in bed. Also a great transition piece from co-sleeping to a regular crib.

I purchased this electric oven for over 5,000 about 3 years ago, the oven was lightly used, unfortunately I am moving and can't take this beautiful oven with me. Should you have any questions email me, there is a little wiggle room on the price. Do not miss the opportunity to own this magnificent oven from a premier brand at a fraction of the price.

History and nature meet upon the beautiful grounds of Cloverleaf Memorial Cemetery. Nestled in central New Jersey in the Woodbridge Township, Cloverleaf features well maintained lawns and mature shade trees. The grounds of Cloverleaf are part of history; memories of the past flicker through the air and a peaceful solitude can be found when visiting the grounds. 
With grave markers dating back to 1926, Cloverleaf sits upon historical ground. George Washington stayed in Woodbridge on his travel to take the office of President back in 1789. Woodbridge was also home to several historical figures including Captain John Pike and Tom Bloomfield. As one of the largest townships in the country, Woodbridge is not only historically significant but also beautifully preserved. 
Cloverleaf is a non-sectarian cemetery located between New York City and Philadelphia. It is a place dedicated to paying honor to departed loved ones and remembering their lives. Cloverleaf is where family and friends can gather to spend time in a place where beauty and tranquility are found in abundance.

Talk about steely good looks. In addition to a 360-degree wraparound design, our metal travel mugs are crafted with lightweight stainless steel - so they're pretty much indestructible. Plus, they're double-walled to keep drinks hot (or cold), fit in almost any size cup holder and are easy to clean.

Limited Edition of just 200 Individually numbered pieces! 
 
Weiss Watch Company is proud to offer a mechanical timepiece built in the USA. Each fully mechanical movement is a manually wound Caliber 1001 comprised of over 100 Swiss parts that are hand-finished and assembled in Los Angeles, California. The case and caseback are machined from one solid piece of stainless steel and polished individually by hand. Sapphire crystals are used on the front and back of the case for strength and durability and display our highly finished movement inside. Hands are high polished silver with latte luminescent Super-Luminova paint for legibility in the dark. Dials are machined from one solid piece of naval brass and have been hand painted for maximum legibility. The Limited Issue Field Watch Black Dial is supplied with Horween's Genuine Shell Cordovan black strap. The shells endure a 6-month tanning process at Horween, the oldest operating tannery in America. Skilled artisans tan, stuff, polish, steep in vegetable liquors, hand curry, and hand shave each piece of shell. Each strap is individually handmade in the USA by expert leather craftsmen. Since each one is handcrafted, each strap has its own unique characteristics from the tanning process and handmade nature of the product. The strap is designed for comfort, style, and is made specially to fit the Field Watch with 20mm lug size and an 18mm 316 stainless steel buckle. The Limited Issue Field Watch Black Dial is a limited series of 200 numbered timepieces built by hand. Each individually numbered timepiece is delivered in our custom-built California pine wood box, also built by hand in the USA.

Linley File Cabinet, White: A leather-covered top allows this file cabinet to double as an occasional table in the home office. It is designed to hold both legal and letter size files. Casters on the bottom allow for easy mobility, and the bottom file drawer is supported by an extra caster to keep the cabinet from tipping forward.In 1985 Trig Liljestrand began importing furniture from his native Sweden into the United States, as part of his mission to make beautifully designed furniture affordable and available to everyone. Today the Euro ̧ Style design team continues to use the best materials to create wonderfully designed and crafted furnishings.

I'm no longer doing any home recording and I'm selling my pro recording equipment. This RME ADI-8 DS converter has only approximately 75hrs of use. There are zero marks on it and it is basically in brand new condition. Check out Sweetwater or Sam Ash for complete specs. 
 
DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS 
The ADI-8 DS is an 8 channel AD/DA converter with reference approach. The compact 19"" 1U rackmount enclosure includes several outstanding features, like Intelligent Clock Control (ICC), SyncCheckÂ®, SyncAlignÂ®, TDIF/ADAT converter and Bit Splitter. AD- and DA-circuit automatically operate either independently or linked. The latest 24 bit converters with 128 times oversampling achieve 117 dBA true dynamic range. All digital inputs and outputs operate at full 24-bit resolution. If you have been waiting for a flexible, fully professional yet affordable multi-channel converter - the wait is over. 
 
DS stands for Double Speed, meaning double sample rate. As ADATÂ® optical does not support sample rates higher than 48 kHz the DS mode requires two channels to transmit the data of one channel. The used method called Sample Split is compatible to S/MUX, and also found in the Hammerfall and Hammerfall Light. The combination Hammerfall/ADI-8 DS allows DVD-compatible Hi-End recordings (up to 8 channel @ 96 kHz), at an astonishing low price. 
 
Features: 
8 channel AD-converter, completely symmetrical and DC-coupled audio path, 117 dBA SNR AD 
8 channel DA-converter, balanced output, 112 dBA DA 
ADAT optical inputs, 24 bit, based on RME's unsurpassed Bitclock PLL for sample accurate lock

TDIF-1 interface, 24 bit, Low Jitter PLL, Emphasis support, DA-88 compatible 
Bit Split/Combine, Yamaha 02R compatible technique to record 24 bit data onto 16 bit machines 
Copy Mode adds a unique 24 bit ADAT to/from TDIF converter 
Bit Split/Combine, Copy Mode, ADAT and TDIF usable in all combinations 
Digital Patchbay operation, allows to copy, duplicate and distribute the digital input signals 
Dither available, for full compatibility to 16 bit even at 96 kHz 
SyncCheck, unique technology to check clock synchronisation 
Virtual Sample Buffer, allows to use the internal Low Jitter Clock (quarz crystal) even for DA-conversion

Celestion CF18VJD 18"" Professional Subwoofer 1600W 
Celestion's CF18VJD 18"" subwoofer features an advanced, FEA optimized motor for maximum output and symmetrical cone movement, which results in low harmonic distortion, as well as two demodulation rings for low electromagnetic distortion. 
To keep control of the driver when used with high power amplifiers (of up to 1,600 watts RMS), Celestion employs double suspension and a multi-roll surround for exceptional linearity during extreme excursion moments that are common with lower frequency reproduction. A lightweight carbon fiber and Kevlar-loaded paper cone is used due to its rigidity and ability to respond quickly to audio impulses. 
Intelligent heat management is designed into the cast aluminum chassis, high temperature 5"" inside/outside wound voice coil, and extensively vented ferrite magnet which prevents thermal compression and the resulting loss and sensitivity. Last, but certainly not least, this 18"" subwoofer has an amazing 9 mm of Xmax to move massive amounts of air. 
For more information on this subwoofer, check out Celestion's BUILD THIS! project featuring the CF18VJD.

I'm moving out of my apartment and need to sell some furniture! This listing is for a low double dresser and it's accompanying nightstand. Both are very high quality, heavy and sturdy, and in great condition. Bought them together a few years ago. I'd like to sell them together, but if not, I'll sell the dress for $300 and the nightstand for $100. 
 
The dresser is 5ft 4in wide by 19in deep and 3ft tall. The night stand is 2ft wide by1.5 ft deep and 2ft 5in tall.

I have one pair of black Land's End Waterproof Squall Snow Pants, size 6, in excellent condition.  They were barely used and retail for $69.  They are from a smoke free and pet free home.  Can meet you in Brooklyn Heights or Lower Manhattan.  Thanks! 
 
Product Details from Land's End: 
BUILT WITH IRON KNEES and SEAT! 
From ski slopes to sledding hills, we think our Squall snow bibs pants are the best fully-featured value out there. Waterproof and windproof they are also built with Iron Knees and Seat. What's that? It's a double-layer of extra-tough nylon patched on the knees and seat -- where snow pants need extra protection most. Even better, Grow-a-long legs extend up to two inches for a long-lasting fit that lasts many kids more than one season. Easy ankle zips give them room enough to slide right over snow boots. 
 
FEATURES 
Waterproof and windproof nylon shell 
Iron Knees and Seat 
Grow-a-Long legs extend 2″ for long-wearing value 
PolarThin insulation adds warmth without bulk 
Snow gaiters at hem block out cold and slush 
Elastic waistband and snap close 
Zippered hip pockets keep smaller items safe 
Nylon lining 
(Made to fit over jeans, we recommend selecting your child's exact size)

 Enthusiast owned, super clean, unmolested, serviced and pampered 1998 Mercedes C43 AMG. Clean Title in hand !  
 
123k miles  
 
This is a 2 owner, FL car that has been garaged and serviced it's entire life. It was never in any accident, has no rust or any kind of damage. Everything works on this car ! No leaks ! Ice cold A/C!  
 
I have original window sticker - $56,000 in 1998 ! Almost double the price of a regular w202 c280!  
 
After I bought the car I had the following performed:  
 
Complete Tune-up including Engine/gearbox/Rear diff oil change, Brake fluid and Coolant flush, New air filters, new gas filter, new wiper, new wheel alignment.  
 
Following parts were installed less then 3 month ago:  
 
German made FK Sport adjustable coilovers 
4 Genuine Carlsson CR 1/12 Wheels 18"" with Brand New Tires mounted and balanced 
Custom stainless steel exhaust system (the sound is intoxicating + noticeable gain in HP)  
Brand new windshield  
Brand new JVC Bluetooth system (allows hands free use of your cell + you can listen to any music from your phone without any wires etc !)  
Custom S600 front grill  
Yellow HID/Xenon fog lights  
Rain Window guards  
Wireless Tire pressure monitoring system  
Novatek B40 Full HD 1080P Mini Car Dash Camera DVR  
 
 
Car is pretty rare. Being said that it is one of the cleanest, most thoughtfully and elegantly modified c43s out there. You can buy one cheaper and drive it as is (most likely won't happen as cheap ones always need work) or you can spend a little more and buy this fully sorted out C43 that looks and drives beautifully! 
 
 

reason I'm selling the C43 is because I have 3 classic MBs and only 2 car garage. Enthusiasts will understand the dilemma ;) Other MBs I have are 94 e500 W124 and 98 SL500 R129

This board's outline is derived from 70's Pipeline guns but shaped with a modern foil.  Flat bottom for speed, down rails for excellent hold, and a little extra thickness for winter surf.  Nothing like the speed and buttery smoothness of a single fin in heavy waves.  Paddles great, gets in early and you're off to the races.

I am offering a unique, custom built entertainment center / bookcases / storage unit. 
 
The overall size is approx. 160""L x 22""W x 50""H.  The height from floor to the base of the book shelves is 26"".   
 
This is a custom made piece of cabinetry in three separate pieces that can be joined together.  It consists of two identical end-pieces with six roll-out drawers (segmented to hold CDs but will hold DVDs) and two double-book shelves (24 inches height) and a central piece with four black, smoked glass doors behind which sit three shelved cabinets suitable for storing cable box, DVD player, stereo etc. and a counter-top which can easily fit a 40+ inch TV.   
The wood is a medium-dark (beech?) wood.  The unit is designed with openings to easily run cables and power cords through the shelving.  The book shelves will probably store 160-200 books. 
 
The unit's original cost was in excess of  $7,000 built by Manhattan Cabinetry.      
 
Local buyers only.  I do not accept Paypal or checks. 
FINAL PRICE REDUCTION before giving the unit to charity.

Selling my LeMond Nevada City 58cm. Bought the frame a few years ago and built it custom. The paint is chipping in a few areas, but the Reynolds 853 double butted tubing is strong and the frame is straight. The bike has never been in an accident and always stored indoors.  
 
-Alex Rim on front with gatorskin tire, mavic open pro on back with shimano 8 speed casette. schwalbe tire less than a year old.  
 
-sunrace 8 speed thumb shifter less than a year old. Shimano acera rear derailleur also less than a year old. 
 
-has been tuned up recently and cassette taken apart and cleaned. the bike shifts smooth and rides beautifully.  
 
The bike is perfect for someone looking to get a little more serious about road cycling while also getting something that's perfectly suited for city riding. The bike can also be set up for touring with eyelets for a front and rear rack. I had a front rack on it that held some significant weight from time to time.  
 
I rode this bike all around NYC for three years, but another bike has become my main rider, so unfortunately it's time to go in order to free up some space. I would keep it if i could. unfortunately most NYC residents aren't lucky enough to have a garage.  
 
call/text whenever to come by for a test ride, or we can meet in a park somewhere close by.

Cinelli Pepper Road Handlebar Black 44cm with Black Oury grips and Tektro RL720 brake levers 
 
Bought this new to put on my mystic rats but I prefer my bullhorns so I'm getting rid of it. Perfect condition except for a small smudge on the Cinelli logo where the stem grabbed it when I put it on. I literally bought this, put it on my bike, decided I didn't like it and took it off, it has been used a total of 5 minutes tops. 
 
I will also throw in a plastic Cinelli seat that came with my bike, and a pair of metal pedals. Pick up at my house in Glendale. 
 
Description: 
 
Pepper is Cinelli's new riser bar made from forged 6061 T6 aluminum custom double-butted to particular thicknesses for an extremely high level of strength and fatigue resistance.

Dark Green (nicer than the photo shows here) photographers 11X14X3 inch heavier duty portfolio case with adjustable shoulder strap.  Why not be a bit different than Black?   Padded double exterior handle on the top center.  Strap lugs left & right, clips/clasps work great.  In really great shape, some glue marks where an address window used to be, one small cut. Sturdy and nice shape, nice lining.   
 
I will include a portfolios filled with acetate pages.  You can't go wrong.  $65. or best offer.  
 
A ""quirk"" of Craigslist is that listings drop off the site about once or twice a week. When you see a listing then it is no longer shown it does not necessarily mean it was sold. Every few days I have to re-list/refresh the inventory U re-post it. I have no idea why. Please keep an eye out for any of my listings that don't show up. Give it a couple of days U chances are that it will show up again. Thanks.

The original 4Runner was a compact SUV and little more than a Toyota pickup truck with a fiberglass shell over the bed,  but the model has since undergone significant independent development into a cross between a compact and a mid-size SUV. The April 2007 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety report shows the 4Runner to have one of the lowest death rates for all vehicles on the road during years measured. The IIHS rates the 4Runner as Good overall in the frontal offset crash test and Good overall in the side impact test on vehicles with side airbags,  these scores rank the 4Runner as among the best truck d mid-size SUVs in crash tests. The 4runner received the Good rating in 13 of the 14 measured categories.

The ultimate in fork mount technology that's also ultra easy to install and use.  
The Top-of-the-Line in Thule Fork Mount Technology 
The ultimate in fork mounts, the Thule 518 Echelon Fork Mount Rooftop Bicycle Carrier raises the bar on fork mounts with its new, improved ETC (Equalized Twin Cam) clamping system. The Echelon features a centrally-located cam lever, and a new ergonomic adjustment knob that allows rapid loading and unloading of bicycle, for the ultimate in ease of use. The Echelon fork-mount rooftop bike carrier fits all disc and suspension combinations with standard 9mm axles. This bike carrier has a dual-lock design that locks both the bike to the carrier, and the carrier to your rooftop rack. The wheel tray fits tires up to 2.6 inches wide with high-profile rims, and carries bicycles with wheelbases up to 48 inches. This system fits both Thule and Yakima load bars, and is Thule One-Key System compatible so you can easily keep it locked and secure without a bunch of extra keys. Please note, locks are not included. 
 
Self-adjusting clamp automatically adjusts to fit a variety of fork dropout thicknesses for a secure hold.  
Corrosion resistant double-wall aluminum tray provides maximum strength and rigidity.  
Ratcheting wheel strap, with included adapter for road bikes, secures rear wheel to wheel tray.  
Installation and Use 
The Echelon comes nearly fully assembled, requiring only the included hex wrench and your own two hands to easily assemble in little time. Installation begins with the combined Echelon head assembly / wheel tray which provide the base for securing a bike's forks (head assembly) and a stable mounting platform for you back tire (wheel tray). Following some simple preassembly to these components, users have just to attach the head section and wheel tray to their rack's load bar with the hex wrench and included knobs as well as the included mounting plates and other hardware that allows for square or rounded cross bars. The Echelon is now ready for your bike. 
 
To load your bike remove the front wheel and stow it in your vehicle. Next, open the head assembly cover/clamp exposing the pressure dial at the tip of the assembly. Loosening this dial creates initial space along the skewer running through the head assembly that your front fork's dropouts connect to. Now, place your bike's fork dropouts onto the skewer ends evenly on both sides. Adjust the pressure dial to ensure a firm but not overly tight hold on your dropouts, then close the cover/clamp partially. Correct clamping pressure occurs automatically when half way down the cover/clamp's arc you feel resistance. If you feel this, everything should be aligned correctly and you can fully close the cover/clamp. If not, repeat for the best results. At this point Echelon owners who have opted for a One-Key lock, sold separately and installed into the head assembly, can lock their bike to the carrier and the carrier to the rack simultaneously. A ratcheting wheel strap is provided to secure the rear wheel to the wheel tray and includes an adapter for use with road bike wheels. To remove your bike simply remove the wheel strap you installed, unlock the lock on the head assembly (if installed), lift the cover/clamp and remove your bike.

About Thule 
Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

  Car Factory Direct will   sell, share, or spam your mobile number. Standard text messaging rates may apply. Car Factory Direct is far from your typical sort of car dealership. At Car Factory Direct, our job is to make buying a car affordable and easy. You can take care of the entire car buying process right online, and when you buy from us, you will know that you got a good price. All of our vehicles are priced at wholesale prices. There are no negotiations necessary because the sticker on the window is already the best price. We price these vehicles to move, and if they don’t move within 30 days, then we send them off to auction. So if you see something that you like, then you had better act fast.

A gorgeous, top-of-the-line custom kitchen designed for a super high-end loft building in Tribeca. Removed when the apartment was converted to a duplex. Features:  
 
-Limed oak Poggenpohl cabinetry (www.poggenpohl.com) 
-Slab stone Coasta Esmeralda counters 
-Appliances included: Thermador cook-top and double-oven, Miele dishwasher, range and range hood.  (the refrigerator and washer/dryer shown in the pics are not included) 
 
It's a component cabinet system so it can be rearranged in many different ways to fit your space. There's a ridiculous amount of cabinet space (including a very-efficient corner pantry), so you'd still have plenty of space if you need to eliminate some of the cabinets to fit into your space.   If the dark green stone counters are not the look you want, you can install a different countertop. 
 
I acquired the kitchen from its original owner with the intent to use it to renovate my apartment in Brooklyn, but my renovation plans have since been put on hold indefinitely (cost estimates were far more than I budgeted for), so I no longer need the kitchen. It's now being stored in my basement in Williamsburg Brooklyn.  I'd be happy to show it to you if you want to see it in person.

  Car Factory Direct will   sell, share, or spam your mobile number. Standard text messaging rates may apply. Car Factory Direct is far from your typical sort of car dealership. At Car Factory Direct, our job is to make buying a car affordable and easy. You can take care of the entire car buying process right online, and when you buy from us, you will know that you got a good price. All of our vehicles are priced at wholesale prices. There are no negotiations necessary because the sticker on the window is already the best price. We price these vehicles to move, and if they don’t move within 30 days, then we send them off to auction. So if you see something that you like, then you had better act fast. When you buy a vehicle from Car Factory Direct, you can pick it up at either of our two locations, or we can deliver it to you directly. With a location in Milford, Connecticut, and a location in Allentown, Pennsylvania, we can serve customers all throughout the Northeast. Browse through our inventory today!

  Car Factory Direct will   sell, share, or spam your mobile number. Standard text messaging rates may apply. Car Factory Direct is far from your typical sort of car dealership. At Car Factory Direct, our job is to make buying a car affordable and easy. You can take care of the entire car buying process right online, and when you buy from us, you will know that you got a good price. All of our vehicles are priced at wholesale prices. There are no negotiations necessary because the sticker on the window is already the best price. We price these vehicles to move, and if they don’t move within 30 days, then we send them off to auction. So if you see something that you like, then you had better act fast. When you buy a vehicle from Car Factory Direct, you can pick it up at either of our two locations, or we can deliver it to you directly. With a location in Milford, Connecticut, and a location in Allentown, Pennsylvania, we can serve customers all throughout the Northeast. Browse through our inventory today!

Brand new. 
Never used. 
Made around the year 2000. 
Slight rust, but overall great condition. 
 
Tizona is the name of the sword carried by Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, El Cid, which was used to fight the Moors in Spain according to the Cantar de Mio Cid. The name Tizón translates to burning stick, fireball. 
 
A sword identified with Tizona is on display at the Museo de Burgos, in Burgos, Spain. 
 
Today, the Tizona Del Cid is one of Spain's most cherished and important relics. This treasured replica of the Tizona Del Cid sword is beautifully crafted with a wire-wrapped handle and intricately detailed guard. 
 
The Tizona del Cid sword belonged to the Castilian knight Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar , known as ""El Cid Campeador"" in the 11th century. El Cid was the prototype of the knight and a loyal vassal who took part with his king, Alphonse VI, in the conquest of Toledo. Subsequently, El Cid conquered the city, and kingdom of Valencia (which he ruled there until his death in 1099) from the Arabians (Moors). El Cid was a great war hero, a superior and extremely successful soldier of fortune, who apparently never lost a battle. To this day, Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar is known as a hero of Christian Spain, due to his excellent achievements in the the Reconquest of Spain from the Moors. His title, El Cid Campeador, derives from ""El Cid"", a Moorish title of respect, from Arabic al sayyid ""Lord""; ""Campeador"" is Spanish for ""Champion"". 
 
The El Cid Sword pays tribute to this legendary Knight of Spain.  
 
The Tizona, or Tizón, is one of the swords (together with La Colada) attributed to El Cid in Spanish literature. According to the Cantar de Mio Cid, El Cid won the sword from its previous owner, King Yucef in Valencia. Afterward, it was given by El Cid to his sons-in-law, the Infantes de Carrión but eventually returned into the possession of El Cid. 
 
Similar to the other sword attributed to El Cid, La Colada, there exists little historical evidence verifying the existence of a sword named Tizona belonging to Rodrigo Díaz. Later there developed the common opinion that identified the sword of James I of Aragon, named Tisó, with the one attributed to El Cid in the Cantar de gesta, but this is contrasted with the Llibre dels fets (a series of autobiographical chronicles including James I of Aragon) in which the Tisó is described in detail without any mention of El Cid, most likely owing to a simple coincidence of name. Also, the Tisó of the James I was descended from Ramon Berenguer I, who was in possession of the sword until 1020. This makes it unlikely that the sword would have passed from its previous owners to El Cid and that it would then have returned to the House of Aragon. It seems more logical that the Tisó was always in Aragon possession and that the confusion arises from a coincidental similarity in naming. 
 
There exist various Tizonas which have been attributed to El Cid. One of these figured in the treasure stock of the regent house of Castilla that was transferred by Álvaro de Luna, recovered in 1452 and placed in an inventory of the Alcázar of Segovia. In the inventory there remains the description of ""a sword called Tizona, that belonged to El Cid; it has a channel in each side, with gilded lettering; it has a hilt, and cross, and a block of silver, and in relief castles and lions and a small golden lion on each part of the cross; and has a scabbard of red leather lined with green velvet."" This sword was ceremonial, owing to its adornment (which reflects its Castillian heraldry) and would have belonged to a member of the Castillian royalty or their family. After this mention in the inventory list there are no other historical notices, although the blade currently residing in the Royal Armory of Madrid could be the same one described in 1503.[2] 
 
Another presumed Tizona belonged to the Marqueses de Falces, to whom the sword was given by Fernando II of Aragon. It has been kept since at least the 17th century in the Castle of Marcilla and that is currently on display in the Museum of Burgos alongside other presumed relics of El Cid. 
 
The sword at Burgos is 103 centimetres (41 in) long and weighs 1.1 kilograms (2.4 lb). Tizona was supposedly forged in Córdoba, though considerable amounts of Damascus steel can be found in its blade. 
 
There are two inscriptions on the sword: 
 
    IO SOI TISONA FUE FECHA EN LA ERA DE MIL E QUARENTA -- Medieval Castilian for: ""I am Tizona, made in the year 1040"", but in Spanish medieval sources, ""era"" implies Hispanic Era, by which the History of Spain starts in 38 BC, so the intended date has been presumed to be AD 1002. 
 
And: 
 
    AVE MARIA ~ GRATIA PLENA ~ DOMINUS TECUM -- Latin for: ""Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee"", St. Gabriel Archangel's greeting to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Gospel according to St. Luke. 
 
The adornment of the sword has a plain pommel, a long and conical hilt, lined with iron; the hilt is curved and the sideboards contain spikes. All of these traits are characteristic of a typology dating to the ends of the 15th century. The inscription has caused some discussion, in that the sword, if historically accurate, could not have been made in the year 1040. There have been arguments, however, pointing out that the medieval Spanish use of the word ""era"" implies Hispanic Era, in which the history of Spain starts in 38 BC, making the actual date of the sword AD 1002. Still controversial is the use of the word Tizona, that came into use only with the 14th century, as opposed to Tizón which is the term used to refer to the sword in the oldest sources. Menéndez Pidal has expressed the opinion that the sword is a forgery of the 16th century. Other authors, like Bruhn, postulate that the blade could also be the apocryphal Colada that was described in the same inventory of 1503. The recent investigations of the Complutense University of Madrid, published in 2001, signal that the sword is from the 11th century; nevertheless the Curator of the Royal Armory Álvaro Soler del Campo points out that the sword is formed of three joined pieces and that their typology is the same as that of the handle, adornment, and the inscription, from the era of the Catholic Monarchs.[3] 
 
The King Fernando the Catholic gave the sword to Pedro de Peralta y Ezpeleta, the first Count of Santisteban of Lerín, for services rendered in the negotiations that led to his marriage with Isabel of Castile. This sword remained in the control of the marquis of Falces until the 20th century in the Palacial Castle of Marcilla. The sword is described there as: ""With a handle and hilt of completely black iron, double-sided blade, thin, polished, smooth."" 
 
The sword was declared Bien de Interés Cultural on January 18, 2003. 
 
After the Spanish Civil War, the sword that belonged to the Marquis of Falces and was later deposited in the Madrid Museum of Ejército was moved to its new site in the Alcázar of Toledo. The owner José Ramón Suárez del Otero, marquis of Falces, offered its sale to the Ministry of Culture (Spain), which declined its purchase due to a lack of historical proof that it had belonged to El Cid and for the elevated price demanded by the owner (reports from the ministry valued it somewhere between 200,000-300,000 euros, according to Reuters). It was finally acquired in 2007 by the Castile and León and the Cabinet of Commerce and Industry of Burgos[4] The price paid to the marquis of Falces for the sword was 1.6 million euros.[5] It was expected that its final destination would be the same cathedral that houses the tomb of El Cid and his wife Jimena along with other items related to El Cid. 
 
In the heroic poem Cantar de Mio Cid, Tizona's power depends on the wielder and it frightens unworthy opponents. When the infantes of Carrión have Tizona, they underestimate the power of the sword, due to their cowardice, but when Pero Vermúdez is going to fight Ferrán González and unsheathes Tizona (given as a present from El Cid), Ferrán González yells and surrenders, cowering in terror at the sight of Tizona. 
 
Verses 3642-3645:[6] 
 
    Él dexó la lança, e mano al espada metió; 
    cuando lo vio Ferrán González, conuvo a Tizón, 
    que antes qu'el golpe esperasse, dixo: -¡Vençido sói!- 
 
Translation: 
 
    He [Pero Vermúdez] let go the lance and took the sword in hand; 
    when Ferrán González saw that, he recognized Tizona 
    and before the expected blow said, ""I am defeated!""

Brand new vintage Everlast training gloves with metal inserts. 
Weigh almost half a pound each. 
 
Yeah, these gloves look like something Ali, Foreman, Norton and co. would be using, but that doesn't make them bad (kids at some boxing gyms think they are ""strange""). Hammers haven't changed much in the recent past either. 
 
They are listed as ""speed bag"" gloves, but are good for the heavy bag as well. 
 
Wrap your hands, put them on, and go to town. The extra weight is nice. The lack of support as you'd have in a sparring or fighting glove will really help with your technique. Wrist, angle and thumb errors will be immediately noticed. 
 
These gloves will also toughen up your hands (knuckles) for sparring.

Selling this Vintage Mid Century Metal Rolling Bar Serving Cart. It has a black Tone Metal Frame. It has Plastic Wheels. The cart folds up for out of the way storage. It measures about 16"" across, 33"" high.  
Ideally, your place would include an outfitted wet bar at which you could entertain hordes of partygoers. Alas, for most of us, that doesn't seem to be in the cards. Improvise with an old-school bar cart, which has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts in recent years. Equal parts style and function, it will pull double-duty (storage and serving), while instantly adding a cool retro vibe to any space. It has wheels, so you can scoot it around as you see fit, but we prefer treating it as a piece of furniture. 
The fifties were a glorious time for designers. Creativity was at a post-war peak, industrial technologies permitted the use of materials and shapes that would have been impossible only a decade prior. The war had made America very conscious of Europe and this new connection formed a commercial byproduct in the way of increased trade. Danish and Italian designs were making their way overseas and into New York showrooms. The biggest change in lifestyle at this time came from the television. Once designers recognized the enormous market for TV related furnishings - they appeared and in great variety! Here is a modern styled TV cart. These were used to push the heavy television sets around. The style used was pure modern - to fit the modern 'new' nature of television. Thin lines, dynamic angles. When a heavy television was able to be effortlessly rolled from the living room to the dining area to watch and eat at the same time, a new trend was born - TV at mealtime.

 The car is 100% mechanically sound, adult owned, and well maintained. The only reason I am selling this car is because I am picking up my Porsche this weekend, and I do not need two toys. Oil and oil filter changed with Castro edge syntec religiously every 3,000 miles. The transmission fluid was changed when the clutch and flywheel were done this summer as well. The transmission goes in and out of every gear with zero issues. I bought the car completely stock from an older gentlemen who let it sit in his garage aside from weekends, so I know exactly what has been done to it and how it has been treated. It has never been run on anything but the factory tune, and has never seen a racetrack either unlike the majority of these cars.

These ceramics are from the recent works of Robert Rose. Both the vessels, and all of the art, are entirely original, and entirely from the mind of this profoundly imaginative surrealist artist. The finish is luminous. The narrative is sublime. These works retail for $3500 in New York or Chicago galleries. 
 
In the artists' own words, this will give the viewer a sense of the symbology of this outstanding work: 
 
'Elixur Vita', Latin for elixur of life, Man's fixation on a formula or a secrete source that one could drink and would bring eternal lasting life. This legend dates back many centuries even before Alexander the Great, where a Middle-eastern sage named Al- Khidr speaks of a source of water which can restore all of ones youth and vitality. Over the centuries the legend grows and is adapted by many cultures, the most infamous story of which was the great Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon's quest for ' The Fountain of Youth'. 
 
Although many hundreds of years have passed since Leon's quest and the likeliness of such a fountain seams ever more unrealistic one can only wonder if some where in a laboratory, scientists being funded by the large pharmaceutical companies aren't hard at work attempting to achieve what Al-Khidr spoke of so long ago. In these modern times medical advancements have certainly brought us nearer to that possibility then ever before, but, if we were to achieve such success, how would we handle such power. As profound of an advancement as it would be, it still would be a double edge sword. 
 
Surrealism is a wonderful artistic medium for exploring the often bizarre and unexplainable inner being, and also so many aspects of human nature. It allows a playful, visual feast of imagination, one that we normally see only in dreams. As in dreams many events are representations of our own personal reality. Other aspects are with all likelihood, just simply the playful mind , free from the constraints of the very structured world we consciously live in, for the better part of each day. Sometimes in my art I like to bring that playful side of the subconscious mind into the composition, weaving it together with aspects of our conscious (factual) world. 
 
Surrealism is a great opportunity for that menagerie of the human psyche, to be expressed. Ironically, when one studies physics and gains knowledge of just how things really work in the physical world, the lines between dream, fantasy, and reality get very blurry. It is quite fascinating, how deceptive the mechanics of our physical ability to perceive reality, really are. For example, when you observe a plane landing it is traveling at nearly 160 mph, yet it looks like its putting along at just 40 mph. That is just one example of the flawed nature of our senses, and the way they allow us to perceive and interpret the world around us. That overlooked truth is a bit surreal, and I find it interesting enough to portray in certain aspects of my art. Life is not always as we perceive it to be. Often, in our interactions with others, we only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear, but always there is the phenomenon of misperception at play. In our attempts to understand life and what it means to us, can we ever really be certain of 'reality' or ""the Truth Within""?. The ying & yang of our own reality and dreams. On some levels, our own dreams can be as vast, magnificent, and as mysterious as the physical world is. Sometimes even more. Kind of a startling story in, and of itself"".

Extra-long sofa that folds down into a double bed in excellent condition!   
 
- Light camel fabric free of rips, stains, or wear - this piece has been used only occasionally in our spare room.   
- Easily folds down into a comfortable bed that is over 7' long for tall guests and can sleep one person or a couple (45"" wide when open) 
- Excellent in long narrow spaces - we loved that this piece does not look like a futon. 
- This model is no longer sold at West Elm but retailed for $999. 
- We will throw in two IKEA wicker storage baskets that fit perfectly underneath. 
- Elevator building - no stairs to navigate when moving.

ALEXIS GEORGIO BEADED LEGGINGS 
 
500 pairs of high quality 4 way stretch mesh fabric, 92% nylon, 8% spandex.  High quality & workmanship and high quality beadwork.  9 different styles, 5 different colors, Black, Ivory, Pink, Denim Blue, Nude.  in 2 sizes.   
 
 Medium fits dress sizes 2 to 8 
 Large fits dress sizes 8 to 16 
 
 CONDITION:  Brand new with labels and tags 
 
I made approx 12,000 pairs and only about 500 remain in the inventory.  I am selling them at $20 per pair which is my cost of just making it and not including shipping and custom fees.  If I want to make them now the make will cost double as much.   My wholesale price to stores were from $45 to $55 per pair.  Retail price was twice or three times as much depending on store and location.

Selling a beautiful BRAND NEW, WITH TAGS, CHRISTOPHER HAYES, raincoat/trenchcoat.  It is medium gray in color, size 46R, double breasted style with belt, and has very plush zip out lining.  I purchased this coat at Macy's for $175 and never had the opportunity to wear it.  It is still in the original plastic bag with tags attached to the sleeve as seen in the pictures.  I need cash quickly, so I am sacrificing this beautiful rain coat for $50.  Believe me, at this price you will not be disappointed!!!

Chef'sChoice EdgeCrafter Diamond Sharpening Stone is a professional sharpening tool for restoring and sharpening blades and maintaining precision, razor-sharp edges of all your knives. No maintenance, durable, sharpens many times faster than natural stones. 
  
The EdgeCrafter comes in a hardwood holding tray with cover and rubber feet on the bottom to minimize slipping. The tray holds the single-sided diamond stone, with ideal diamond grit size for repairing and restoring the basic shape of the edge, and sharpening of stainless steel knives with a razor sharp, cutting edge. 
  
A proprietary metal alloy permanently secures 100% diamond crystal abrasives to the steel support plate that is exceptionally flat for precision sharpening. Optimum spacing pattern of diamonds prevents loading of the abrasive surface with fillings. No lubricating or pre-soaking applied on the surface of the stone is required.  
  
The EdgeCrafter is suitable for all household knives (double-edged or single-bevel blade), except scalloped or serrated blades, and any blade regardless of its composition.  
  
28 years of tradition has brought Chef'sChoice products to the edge of perfection. This ultimate sharpening tool is a great value in a diamond sharpening stone.

2 toter 64 Gal. trash cans. Purchased brand new and used for a few months before realizing they're a little large for DSNY to lift and empty. Gave them a good cleaning and ready for a new home. Local pick up $75 for the pair. (Essentially buy 1 get one free) 
 
 
Info about them below: 
 
The Toter residential curbside heavy duty trash cart is a 2-wheeled garbage container with a molded-in axle and attached lid. Toter carts are manufactured through their patented advanced rotational molding process using medium density polyethylene. This allows for added rigidity and extra material in critical wear areas, creating their patented rugged rim at the top edge and the wear strip at the bottom of the container. Toter carts offer a service life expectancy virtually double that of other brands and each comes with a 10 year warranty. They are ANSI certified, the preferred choice of professional haulers and are compatible with automated or semi-automated collection waste truck lifters. For the homeowner, the industry's best tilt-to-roll ratio and easy maneuverability create an effortless roll to the curb. The large footprint and aerodynamic design create a superior wind and set-down stability. The trash carts are available in 32 Gal., 48 Gal., 64 Gal. and 96 Gal. sizes. A distinctive Greenstone textured finish masks normal wear and tear and keeps your Toter looking new for years. 
Manufactured with polyethylene using up to 50% recycled content 
Durable carts are equipped with 2 rugged wheels and a molded-in axle for easy tilt/roll and sturdy maneuvering over any terrain 
Universal design is compatible with automated and semi-automated curbside collection waste truck lifters 
Lid is attached to keep contents inside

This is currently the flagship Yamaha student flute that is highly recommended by many band directors and flute teachers. It's in shiny like-new condition with ""Made in Japan"" engraved on the body. There is very little difference between a new Yamaha YFL 221 and this flute except that a new Yamaha YFL 221 that you buy now will be Made in China / Made in Indonesia (for sale at $923) vs. this like-new Yamaha flute that has the ""Made in Japan"" stamp engraved on the body (for sale at $450). The shiny surface and good condition of the pads show that this flute has not been played much at all. I am a flute teacher and I can assure you that this Yamaha 221 flute is known to be the best free-blowing instrument in the market and it's very easy to produce a great sound. If interested, please contact by email to make an appointment.

Wide-Screen Double-Sided Poster of Batman with the BatPod from the Dark Knight Film ; measures exactly 37"" inches high by 77"" inches wide. 
 
An Original Official USA Advance Release Custom Poster for the highly anticipated July 18th 2008 Theater and Limited iMax Release of "" The Dark Knight "". The Dark Knight is a 2008 American film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, which rebooted the Batman film series after an eight-year hiatus. Christian Bale reprises the lead role. Batman's primary conflicts in the film include his fight against the Joker (Heath Ledger) and his strained friendship with district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). For his conception of the film, Nolan was inspired by the Joker's first two appearances in the comics and Batman: The Long Halloween. The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago (as was Batman Begins), as well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. The director used an IMAX camera to film six major action sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. The Batsuit was redesigned, with a cowl allowing Bale to move his head. The film also introduces a recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod ( this poster features an amazing image of Batman on the Batpod ). Sadly, this is the last performance of Heath Ledger, who has since passed away from a tragic accidental overdose with pain-killers. The advance preview screenings of the film left many with the belief that this is his greatest film performance yet.

Hendrick's Gin Original AD Poster A MOST UNUSUAL GIN 2' x 3' Rare 2009 Mint New Condition. Large Wall Size Measures exactly : 24"" inches wide by 36"" inches high. This Original Hendrick's Gin Advertising Poster features a beautiful graphic in vintage style of the famed Hendrick's Gin distinctive bottle. Hendrick's Gin is the renowned brand of gin produced by William Grant & Sons in Girvan, Scotland. In addition to the traditional Juniper infusion, Hendrick's uses a hint of Bulgarian Rose followed by a mash of cucumber. Hendrick's Gin is bottled in a dark brown apothecary-style bottle. Hendrick's uses a blend of spirits produced from a Carter-Head Still (constructed in 1948), of which there are only a small number in the world, and a small pot still, originally built in 1860 by Bennett, Sons & Shears. Both have been restored to working order after being bought at auction in the 1960s by current William Grant Life President, Charles Gordon. The two stills produce strikingly different styles of gin due to their different construction and methods of distillation. Voted Best Gin in the World, Wall Street Journal (2003)"" Double Gold winner at the 2004 San Francisco International Spirits Competition of the Year.
