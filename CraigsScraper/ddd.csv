This is a forward facing, side by side jogging buggy in excellent condition. The seats are not rigid like some others. More comfortable for the kids. Better shock absorbing for the unexpected bump in the road! Tires are larger bicycle type tires. These are shock absorbing as well as easier to jog with and push. Tires are in excellent shape, no dry rot. Very stable when running, and has a hand brake. Can't be attached to a bicycle. We used it as our main buggy when going out to the mall, park, beach etc. 
Super easy to partially disassemble & reassemble to put in your car/minivan. Just pull some pins and it flattens right out.

Child booster car seat in excellent condition. It has never been involved in an accident. 
 
This is the seat children pick as often as parents. Kids love cool perks like the hide-away cup holders and the ""big kid"" design features, especially the height-adjustable head support and padded, height-adjustable armrests. Parents love that it helps keep their children safe. It has EPS, energy absorbing foam, and open loop belt guides to help ensure proper seat belt positioning. And when needed, it easily converts to backless booster, giving you years of use.
